# Legacy Mock Scripts

This folder contains legacy mock-data notes and scripts used earlier in the project.

The current, schema-aligned mock scripts live in:
- `scripts/seed-mock-data.ts`
- `scripts/purge-mock-data.ts`
- `scripts/README.md`

Use the `scripts/README.md` file for the latest setup and command list.
