# UI Team - Course Code Validation Update Request

## Date: 2026-01-20
## From: UI Team
## To: API Team
## Priority: HIGH - BLOCKER
## Related Issues: UI-ISS-046

---

## Issue Summary

Course creation fails with 400 Bad Request. The API rejects valid course codes due to overly restrictive validation.

---

## Current API Behavior

The API validates course codes with pattern: `^[A-Z]{2,4}[0-9]{3}$`

This requires exactly 2-4 uppercase letters followed by exactly 3 digits (e.g., CS101, MATH200).

**Error returned:**
```
Course code must match pattern: 2-4 uppercase letters followed by 3 digits (e.g., CS101)
```

---

## Requested Change

Update course code validation to allow:
- 1-35 characters
- Letters (uppercase or lowercase) and numbers only
- Pattern: `^[A-Za-z0-9]+$` with max length 35

---

## Files Likely Needing Updates

Based on error messages, these files likely contain the validation:

| File | Location |
|------|----------|
| `src/controllers/academic/courses.controller.ts` | Create/update course validation |
| `src/services/academic/courses.service.ts` | Service-level validation |

---

## UI Changes Already Completed

The UI has been updated to match this new validation:
- Zod schema: `z.string().min(1).max(35).regex(/^[A-Za-z0-9]+$/)`
- Helper text: "Up to 35 letters and numbers"
- Removed forced uppercase conversion

---

## Request

Please update the API course code validation to:
1. Accept alphanumeric characters (A-Z, a-z, 0-9)
2. Allow 1-35 characters in length
3. Update error message to: "Course code must contain only letters and numbers (max 35 characters)"
